🏥 MRGENSEE — Smarter Emergency Response Platform
🚨 Real-Time Hospital Availability & Emergency Routing System
🧠 The Problem

Every second in a medical emergency can mean the difference between life and loss — yet, in India:

⏱ 15–30 critical minutes are often lost searching for available hospitals.

🚑 Ambulances are redirected multiple times before finding a hospital with free beds.

📞 Families rely on outdated information or endless phone calls to locate help.

🏥 Healthcare data remains fragmented, with no unified platform for real-time visibility of ICU beds, ventilators, or ER availability.

These delays aren’t just inconvenient — they’re life-threatening.

💡 The Solution — MRGENSEE

MRGENSEE bridges this critical gap by connecting patients, ambulances, and hospitals through live, verified emergency data.

🧭 Smart Emergency Routing — instantly find the nearest ready hospital.

🏥 Verified Hospital Dashboard — hospitals update real-time bed and ambulance availability.

📊 Real-Time Data System — transparent coordination between hospitals, responders, and patients.
